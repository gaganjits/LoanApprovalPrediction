## Overview

Traditional loan approval processes are time-consuming, prone to human bias, and often result in inconsistent decision-making. This project addresses these challenges by implementing an automated machine learning system that:

- Processes loan applications in under 1 second
- Makes objective decisions based on data-driven insights
- Achieves 98.13% accuracy on unseen data
- Scales to handle thousands of applications simultaneously
- Reduces operational costs and improves customer satisfaction

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: 98.13% accuracy with Random Forest classifier
- **Multiple Models**: Comparison of 5 different ML algorithms
- **Comprehensive EDA**: Detailed exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- **Production Ready**: Complete prediction pipeline with saved artifacts
- **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple applications at once
- **Well Documented**: Extensive documentation and code comments
- **Easy Integration**: Simple Python API for seamless integration

## Dataset

The dataset contains 4,269 loan application records with 12 features:

- **loan_id**: Unique identifier
- **no_of_dependents**: Number of dependents (0-5)
- **education**: Education level (Graduate/Not Graduate)
- **self_employed**: Employment status (Yes/No)
- **income_annum**: Annual income
- **loan_amount**: Requested loan amount
- **loan_term**: Loan term in months
- **cibil_score**: Credit score (300-900)
- **residential_assets_value**: Value of residential assets
- **commercial_assets_value**: Value of commercial assets
- **luxury_assets_value**: Value of luxury assets

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoanApprovalPrediction.git
cd LoanApprovalPrediction
```

```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Quick Start

Run the complete analysis pipeline:
```bash
python run_analysis.py
```

- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Train multiple ML models
- Evaluate and compare performance
- Save the best model and artifacts
- Generate visualizations

### Making Predictions

#### Interactive Mode
```bash
python predict.py
```

#### Programmatic Usage
```python
from predict import LoanApprovalPredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = LoanApprovalPredictor()

# Sample applicant data
applicant_data = {
    'loan_id': 9999,
    ' no_of_dependents': 2,
    ' education': ' Graduate',
    ' self_employed': ' No',
    ' income_annum': 6000000,
    ' loan_amount': 10000000,
    ' loan_term': 10,
    ' cibil_score': 750,
    ' residential_assets_value': 5000000,
    ' commercial_assets_value': 3000000,
    ' luxury_assets_value': 8000000,
    ' bank_asset_value': 4000000
}

# Get prediction
result = predictor.predict(applicant_data)
print(f"Decision: {result['decision']}")
print(f"Approval Probability: {result['probability_approved']:.2%}")
```

#### Batch Processing
```python
import pandas as pd
from predict import LoanApprovalPredictor

# Load multiple applicants
applicants_df = pd.read_csv('new_applicants.csv')

# Make predictions
predictor = LoanApprovalPredictor()
results = predictor.predict_batch(applicants_df)

# Save results
results.to_csv('predictions.csv', index=False)
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python test_prediction.py
```

### Jupyter Notebook

For detailed analysis:
```bash
jupyter notebook loan_approval_prediction.ipynb
```

## Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 98.13% |
| Precision | 98.14% |
| Recall | 98.13% |
| F1-Score | 98.12% |
| Cross-Validation | 98.09% (±0.43%) |

### Confusion Matrix

|          | Predicted Rejected | Predicted Approved | Total |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Actual Rejected** | 527 | 4 | 531 |
| **Actual Approved** | 12 | 311 | 323 |

**Error Analysis**:
- False Positives: 4 (0.47%) - High-risk incorrectly approved
